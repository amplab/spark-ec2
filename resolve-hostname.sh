# Starting new instance in VPC often results that `hostname` returns something like 'ip-10-1-1-24', which is
# not resolvable. Which leads to problems like SparkUI failing to bind itself on start up to that hostname as
# described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5246.
# This script maps private ip to such hostname via '/etc/hosts'.
